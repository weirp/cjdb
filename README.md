# cjdb

I have been involved in a few migration projects, and one good aspect of
them is that they're not necessarily tied to the tech stack being used.
I've used tck/tk and ruby in the past for migration projects.
Clojure is my current favourite language and I have used it over the past 3 or 4
years at work to write some development related tools.

I'm currently working contracting and looking after an oldish java web app.
The codebase had no unit test and the developers don't seem to have come
across the concept of database transactions.

I implemented 'some' unit tests around the new work I was doing and also tried
some tests using an in-memory database.
Currently the schema for that database has been hand-written, and I hope to
at least generate something here that will automate that. (It is currently a bit
behind the real db schema)


Recently I spent about 3 days at my full role working on migration of data
from a legacy application that we were replacing. Clojure was the natural choice.
The client decided that the data involved could be entered manually instead.


This is a collection of tools that might be of use in future migration projects.
I am also hoping to create something that can take a copy of the database
schema add generate a schema for the in-memory database.



## setting up mbrainz database (postgres)
either download a vm or database dump file. I did the latter.

createdb --encoding=UNICODE mbrainz
psql mbrainz
will come back to this.

Nah, will use the virtualbox vm.....
